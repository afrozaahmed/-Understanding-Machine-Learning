And that's it. Let me end by summarizing the key points. First, machine learning has come of age. It's no longer some technology that's only for researchers in far away labs. Machine learning also isn't hard to understand. I hope you agree after watching this, although it can be hard to do well. And finally, I said this before, but I want to say it again because in some ways it might be the most important point I make in the entire course. It is this. It is that machine learning can probably help your organization. I'm David Chappell. Thanks for watching.
