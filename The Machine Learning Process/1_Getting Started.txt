Understanding machine learning means understanding the machine learning process, and the machine learning process is iterative. You repeat things over and over in both big and small ways. The machine learning process also is challenging, typically. It's rarely easy, and the reason is that you're working with what are often large amounts of potentially complex data, and you're trying to find patterns, meaningful patterns, predictive patterns. In this data. This can be hard. It's why we work with specialists. It's why data scientists are often so important to machine learning projects. And finally, the machine learning process is often rewarding. As I've said, the benefits of success here can be substantial, but not always. It's always possible that you will fail. Be aware of that. This process is worth doing in many, many cases, but it doesn't always succeed.
