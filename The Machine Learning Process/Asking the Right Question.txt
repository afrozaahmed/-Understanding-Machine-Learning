The first problem you face in the machine learning process is deciding what question to ask. 

Asking the right question is really important. In fact, 
it's fair to say that choosing what question to ask is the most important part of the process, 
and the reason why this is true is probably obvious. 

It's that if you ask the wrong question, you won't get the answer you care about. 
Choosing what question to ask is really important. And then, you've got to ask yourself,
 do you have the right data to answer this question? Maybe, 
 
for example, the question you want to ask is how can I predict whether a credit card transaction is going to be fraudulent.
Well, maybe it's the case that the most predicted piece of data for doing 
this is whether the customer is a homeowner or a renter,
or maybe it's how long they live at a current address. 
You might not have this data, and you won't know this until some later point, 
if ever. So you want to ask yourself, 
do you think you have the right data to answer this question? Because if you don't, 
you won't get an answer you like. 
   
You also want to ask yourself this, do you know how you'll measure success? 
Because ultimately what you're going to get is a model that makes predictions.
How good must those predictions be to make this entire process qualify as a success.
    
For example, for credit card transactions, 
if you find that you're accurate about fraud prediction in say 8 out of 10 cases, 
is that good enough? How about 6 out of 10? Do you demand 9 out of 10? How do you decide? 
Knowing this up front is important because if you don't, you will never know when you're done.
