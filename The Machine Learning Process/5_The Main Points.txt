The machine learning process begins when you ask the right question. You then need to choose the right data to answer that question and get that data into good shape. As I mentioned earlier, this part of the process typically takes a majority of the time. Once you have the right prepared data, you iterate on that data until you have a model that makes good predictions. You then periodically rebuild that model because you want to reflect the world as it is. And, of course, you deploy the model, if it can't be used, this is just a science project. So deploying the model is a very important part of the process. In the next module, we'll look in more detail at the machine learning process. There is more you need to know, so don't go away.
