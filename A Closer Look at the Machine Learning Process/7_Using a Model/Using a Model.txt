There's one last thing for us to talk about, and that's using a model. In some ways, this is the most important topic of all because until models are used, they don't really have much value. An application, for example, can call a model, providing values for the features the model requires. Remember, models make predictions based on the features that were chosen when the model was trained. The model can then return a value predicted using these features. That value might be whether a transaction is fraudulent, estimated revenue, a list of movie recommendations, or something else. The point here is that machine learning can help people create better applications.
