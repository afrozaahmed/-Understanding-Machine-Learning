The kinds of problems that machine learning addresses aren't the only thing that can be categorized. It's also useful to think about the styles of machine learning algorithms that are used to solve those problems. For example, there are regression algorithms, which are a good option for regression problems. There are decision trees, which are sometimes grouped together into decision forests. There are neural networks, which imitate in some ways how the brain works. One particular way of using neural networks is known as deep learning, something you might have heard of. There are also Bayesian algorithms that use Bayes' theorem to work with probabilities. And there are Kâ€‘means algorithms that are used for clustering. There are also lots more. The details of these algorithms are way outside the scope of this course. They get complicated fast. But having some broad sense of what the styles are is useful.
