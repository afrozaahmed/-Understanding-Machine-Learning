It's common to group machine learning problems into categories. There are lots of categories, but three of them show up an awful lot. One of those is the category called regression. The problem here is that we have data, and we'd like to find a line or curve that best fits that data. Regression problems are typically supervised learning scenarios. An example question would be something like, how many units of this product will we sell next month? A second category of machine learning problems is called classification. Here, we have data that we want to group into classes, at least two, sometimes more than two. When new data comes in, we want to determine which class that data belongs to. This is commonly used with supervised learning and an example question would be something like is this credit card transaction fraudulent? The example I've been using throughout this course fits here because when a new transaction comes in, we want to predict which class it's in, fraudulent or not fraudulent. And often, what you'll get back is not yes or no, but a probability of which class this new transaction might be in. A third category of machine learning problems is commonly called clustering. Here, we have data. We want to find clusters in that data. This is a good example of when we're going to use unsupervised learning because we don't have labeled data. We don't know necessarily what we're looking for. An example question here is something like what are our customer segments? We might not know these things up front, but we can use machine learning, unsupervised machine learning to help us figure that out.
