The machine learning process starts with data. It might be relational data. It might be from a NoSQL database. It might be binary data. Wherever it comes from, though, you need to read this raw data into some data preprocessing module typically chosen from the things your machine learning technology provides. They have to do this because raw data is very rarely in the right shape to be processed by machine learning algorithms. As I said earlier, you'll spend lots of your time, often the majority of your time, in a machine learning project on this aspect of the process. For example, maybe there are holes in your data, missing values, or duplicates or maybe there is redundant data where the same thing is expressed in two different ways in different fields. Or maybe there's information that you know will not be predictive. It won't help you create a good model. You want to deal with all of these issues. The goal is to create training data. The training data, as we saw in my simple example earlier, commonly has columns. Those columns are called features. So, for example, in the simple illustration I showed of data for credit card fraud, there were columns containing the country the card was issued in, the country the card was used in, the amount of the transaction. Those are all features in the jargon of machine learning. And because we're talking now about supervised learning, the value we're trying to predict such as whether a given transaction is fraudulent is also in the training data. In the jargon of machine learning, we call that the target value.
