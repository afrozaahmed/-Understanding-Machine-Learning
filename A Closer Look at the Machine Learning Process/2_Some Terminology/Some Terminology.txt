The first thing we need to do is walk through some terminology. Like most fields, machine learning has its own unique jargon, which you must understand. Let's start with the idea of training data. Training data just means the prepared data that's used to create a model. So rather than prepared data, I will from now on refer to training data. Why is it called training data? Because in the jargon of machine learning, creating a model is called training a model. So training data is used to train, to create, a model. Also, there are two big, broad categories of machine learning. One is called supervised learning, and what it means is that the value you want to predict is actually in the training data. For instance, in the example I've been using of data for predicting credit card fraud, whether or not a given transaction was fraudulent is actually contained in each record. That data in the jargon of machine learning is labeled, and so we're doing what's called supervised learning when we try to predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent. The alternative, unsurprisingly, is called unsupervised learning. And here, the value you want to predict is not in the training data. The data is unlabeled. Both approaches are used, but it's fair to say that the most common approach is supervised learning.
