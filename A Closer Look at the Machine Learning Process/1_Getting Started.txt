It's time we took a closer look at machine learning. In this last module, I want to talk about machine learning concepts in a somewhat more detailed way. I also want to use the terminology that a machine learning person would use. So we're going to talk about training data. We're going to talk about supervised and unsupervised learning. We're going to look at how we classify machine learning problems and algorithms. I'll discuss training a model, which actually means something very simple as you'll see. We'll look at testing a model. And finally, we'll talk just a little more about using a model.
