The focus of this course is on concepts, not implementation of machine learning. Still, it's good to have some basic knowledge of how people implement this stuff. So here are a few examples. One approach is to create custom models in languages like R and Python. These are both popular, and they both have lots of general machine‑learning packages available. They're also both open source. Another option is to use somewhat more specialized, more focused packages to create custom models. Among the most well known of these is TensorFlow. TensorFlow has built‑in support for deep learning, which, as I mentioned earlier, uses neural networks. Another choice is to rely on the cloud services that we're seeing appear for machine learning, such as Amazon SageMaker. These provide complete end‑to‑end solutions, and they let you use other things as well, like Python and TensorFlow. And finally, one more possibility is to realize that you can use machine learning without ever building your own model. Turns out there are lots of fairly standard problems for which predefined models already exist, such as those in Azure Cognitive Services. If you're doing image processing, or speech recognition, or building a recommendations engine, you might just be able to use a pre‑existing model provided for you by typically a cloud service and not have to build your own at all. If this is possible, it's generally the best choice.
