Like most technologies, machine learning can raise ethical issues, 
but the ethics of machine learning are really important. 

It's critical to understand what some of the possible pitfalls are here. Recall the basic model.

We start with data, we process that data using machine learning algorithms to produce a model. 
Great, we then use that model to make decisions. But what happens if the data is biased? For example,
think about bank lending. Suppose we create a model to decide whether or not somebody should get a loan, 
but suppose the data that we use to create that model is from historic loan patterns and suppose that data contains racial bias.

If that's the case, 
our model will also contain that racial bias and we might not even know it because the data could be so large 
that we couldn't see the bias ourselves. Now think about this, 
suppose you've got a model for doing bank landing and someone accuses you of having a biased model.

How can you explain the model decision? It's important to realize that models generated by machine learning are different 
from other kinds of software. 
Traditional software is written directly by people who could work out in great detail exactly what the software does. 
If you need to, somebody could look at that code directly to figure out why it behaves in a certain way. 
With the model, though, models are generated with the machine learning process as I've shown you. 
That process commonly uses complex statistical techniques,
and the result isn't ordinary computer code. 
 
You can't just look at it to see why it's doing what it's doing. 
The point is that some kinds of models can be very hard to explain,
and there are scenarios where you might be required, legally required to explain your model. 

It's important to realize this and to realize this could be of real concern with machine learning. 
The ethics of machine learning are a very important issue to be aware of.
