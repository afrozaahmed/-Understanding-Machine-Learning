Machine learning in a Nutshell

You start with data that contains patterns. You then feed that data into a machine learning algorithm, maybe more than one, that finds patterns in the data. This algorithm generates something called a model. A model is functionality, typically code, that's able to recognize patterns when presented with new data.

Application can then use that model by supplying new data to see if this data matches known patterns such as supplying data about a new transaction. The model can return a probability of whether this transaction is fraudulent. It knows that because of the patterns. Machine learning is a nutshell.
