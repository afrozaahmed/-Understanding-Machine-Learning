## Need a short, clear introduction to machine learning? Watch this.

### Have you ever wondered what machine learning is? That’s what this repo is designed to teach you. You’ll explore the open source programming language R, learn about training and testing a model as well as using a model. By the time you’re done, you’ll have a clear understanding of exactly what machine learning is all about. It’s all ready and waiting for you to jump in whenever you’re ready, and thanks for visiting me here at github.
